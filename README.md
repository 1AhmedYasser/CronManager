# CronManager feature proposal

## Job specification files

* Located in ./DSL
* File name is applied as cron group - namespace, that groups jobs defined in that file together. 
For example, file "training-module.yml" contains Training-Module specific cronjobs. 
* One group (file) can define one or more jobs
* Jobs are defined as yaml files, similarily to Ruuter.
* Job order in file is not determined, each one can and is run separately.

Base Job structure:

```yaml
<job_name>:
  trigger: <trigger_expression>
  type: <job_type>
  startDate: <start_timestamp>
  endDate: <end_timestamp>
```

- Trigger expressions can be set to cron expression or `off`/`false` (NB! without quotes 
which would make this a string) in which case this job is not scheduled to run.
  It can still be run through API.
- `startDate` and `endDate` are optional and stored as timestamps in milliseconds since 1970-01-01 ("epoch"). Cronjobs action
is not executed if current time is before `startDate` or after `endDate`. 

### Implemented job types

#### HTTP request job

```yaml
<job_name>:
  trigger: <trigger_expression>
  type: http
  method: <http_method (i.e GET, POST, etc.)>
  url: <request_url>
```

#### Shell execution job
```yaml
<job_name>:
  trigger: <trigger_expression>
  type: http
  command: <path_to_executable_script>
```

- `path_to_executable_script` is resolved from application root 
folder (defined in `application.appRootFolder`)
- if server is started as a standalone and by `startup.sh` script 
or inside a Docker container, the scripts in `scripts` folder under 
application root are automatically change to executable, in other cases
this has to be done manually.


An example of a configuration is included in DSL/example.yml


## API calls

#### GET /jobs[/<group_name>]
Returns JSON formatted list of jobs in specified group. 
If group_name is omitted, all jobs from all groups are returned.

Example:
```json
[
    "devops":
      [
        {
          "name": "ruuter-health",
          "schedule": "0 0/10 * * * ?",
          "lastExecution": 1704260826,
          "nextExecution": 1704261426,
          "lastResult": "{\"appName\":\"ruuter\",\"version\":\"PRE-ALPHA-2.3.0\",\"packagingTime\":1703237155,\"appStartTime\":1704055509830,\"serverTime\":1704176520940}"
        }
      ],
    
    "training": 
      [
        {
          "name": "train_intents",
          "schedule": "off",
          "lastExecution": -1,
          "nextExecution": -1
        }
      ]
]
```

Timestamp -1 means that this event has not occurred yet (or is not scheduled to occur).

#### GET /running[/<group_name>] 
Returns list of currently running jobs from specified group.
If group_name is omitted, currently running jobs from all groups are returned.

Example: 
```json
[
  {
    "name": "ruuter-priv-health",
    "started": 1704261426
  },{
    "name": "ruuter-pub-health",
    "started": 1704261326
  }
]
```

#### POST /execute/<group_name>/<job_name> 
Executes specified job from specifed group out of sch edule.

Returns list of currently running jobs in that group at the moment of execution in same format as `GET /running``

#### POST /stop/<group_name>/<job_name>
Stops specified job. 

Returns list of currently running jobs in that group at the moment of execution in same format as `GET /running``


### Administrors' API calls

#### POST /reload[/<group_name>] (TODO)

Reloads specified job group from configuration. If no group is supplied, reloads all files.
This can be used when administrator has changed the configuration in runtime.

#### POST /upload/<group_name> (TODO)


## Configuration

- `configPath` - location of job specification files, default value `/DSL`
- `allowedOrigins`- YAML list of CORS allowed IP's 
- `shellEnvironment` - YAML list of key-value pairs (key=value) that should be passed 
to executed scripts 
- `appRootPath`- location of `scripts` folder, usually application root, default `/app`
